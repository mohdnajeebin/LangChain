    "HTMLHeaderTextSplitter is a \"structure-aware\" chunker that splits text at the HTML element level and adds metadata for each header \"relevant\" to any given chunk. It can return chunks element by element or combine elements with the same metadata, with the objective of (a) keeping related text grouped (more or less) semantically and (b) preserving context-rich information encoded in document structures. It can be used with other text splitters as part of a chunking pipeline."
